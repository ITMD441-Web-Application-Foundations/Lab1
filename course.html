    <h1>Course Description</h1>
    <p>In this course students examine core web technologies that are integral in the
      creation of web-based applications typically delivered in a browser. The course will cover fundamental web
      protocols, web application architectures, markup, and scripting languages. A focus will be placed on writing
      modern, standards-compliant JavaScript and how it is used to interact with HTML and CSS to enable rich user
      interfaces and communication with other services. Current frameworks, libraries, and tools will also be
      explored.</p>

    <h1>Expected Outcome</h1>
    <p>Students completing this course learn about the core technologies used to develop
      contemporary web applications. This includes the primary protocols, tools, software, markup, and
      scripting languages used in modern web development and how they have progressed over time. Each
      student successfully completing this course will demonstrate strong foundational knowledge in the
      design and development of web-based internet applications. Students will use standards compliant
      HTML and CSS to create responsive user interfaces targeting modern browsers. Additionally,
      students learn about the JavaScript language, debugging techniques, and JavaScript APIs and how to
      effectively utilize them.</p>
